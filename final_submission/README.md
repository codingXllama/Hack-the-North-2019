# Hack-the-North-2019

Welcome to HTN (Hack the North) 2019! This year our team, comprised of Osama Al-Chalabi, Jatin Mehta, Justin Vuong, and Vraj Prajapati came together to explore the world of CS.

# The Project

We decided to create a learning tool to help assist students of all ages in their learning. It is going to be a tool to help create easy flash cards and quizzes based on the content given to you by the teacher!
